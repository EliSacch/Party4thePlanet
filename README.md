## Deployment
The project is deployed and can be accessed at [Party4ThePlanet](https://p4tp-7e492ba8bb6b.herokuapp.com/)


## Intro
From immersive nature walks that offer participants a profound connection to the earth, to vibrant festivals that celebrate the splendors of our natural world, each event is thoughtfully curated to foster awareness and inspire action. Beyond mere celebrations, Party4thePlanet emphasizes proactive engagements like community clean-ups and enlightening seminars, all aimed at equipping individuals with the knowledge and tools to achieve more sustainable living. 

## Goals

### Statement
In today's fast-paced, urbanized world, many individuals often find themselves disconnected from nature and the environment. This detachment leads not only to ignorance about environmental issues but also a lack of proactive measures to address these challenges. There's a pressing need for platforms that can effectively bridge this gap, fostering awareness, participation, and community action.

### Objectives
Party4thePlanet aims to:

- Promote environmental awareness and education by hosting a myriad of eco events.

- Facilitate community engagement and activism through activities like clean-ups and seminars.
  
- Provide a centralized platform where interested individuals can easily find and participate in eco events in their vicinity.

### Target Audience

Environment enthusiasts, schools, community groups, and any individual or organization keen on participating in or hosting eco-centric events. This includes both those who are already passionate about the environment and those who are just beginning their journey towards being more environmental conscious.

### Benefits

The tracker serves as a hub for community-driven eco actions, ensuring that every individual has the opportunity to be part of the solution, creating ripples of change that can culminate into waves of environmental conservation and restoration.
